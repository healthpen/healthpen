I have no idea how most of you make your Github aesthetic. So deal with . this uhh, decent one.
 
 I go by the name Crow/Gabriel, or any skin i sit as! My pronouns are she/he/it, and I am 19. 

 I have very low social energy and often fall quiet or go afk, keep that in mind. I'm also slow to answer in general ...
 
 C+H is very appreciated, thought I might not run to cuddle you if we're not close friends LOL.

I'm very into Madness Combat and DVN/Hellmet at the moment, thought I'm a big fan of STH, Pokémon, Okami and other Roblox titles that i am too lazy to name. I play Limbus Company and CRK every 3 years

My githubless bitches here... <a href="https://theadmirals.straw.page">Pluto</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/hermesdvn">Hermes</a> :3

DNI IF!!


BASIC DNI, DUH. 

You're under 15, unless i've already talked to you and we've established boundaries.

You support OGEKOM, ALFRED'S PLAYHOUSE, indulge in LOLICON/SHOTACON/PROSHIP content.

If you only intent on trying to get with me (romantically.). Geniunely, i am not and will not get interested.

Same goes for venting. Always ask before doing so ; Unless you're a close friend of mine. 

I also just block freely. If you're blocked, you just annoy me in some fashion and/or are affiliated with people i heavily dislike.

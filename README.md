I have no idea how most of you make your Github aesthetic. So deal with . this uhh, decent one.
 
 I go by the name Crow/Gabriel, or any skin i sit as! My pronouns are she/he/it, and I am 20. 

 I have very low social energy and often fall quiet or go afk, keep that in mind. I'm also slow to answer in general ...
 
 C+H is very appreciated, thought I might not run to cuddle you if we're not close friends LOL.

I'm very into Madness Combat and DVN/Hellmet at the moment, thought I'm a big fan of STH, Pokémon, Okami and other Roblox titles that i am too lazy to name. I play Limbus Company and CRK every 3 years

Say hi to my only githubless baby ...  [Hermes](https://inkthepilot.straw.page) :3 

BEFORE YOU INT! -

Keep in mind i have a vile humor ; not sexual, thought just jokes that seems offensive. I do use the slurs that i reclaim -- never ones i cannot reclaim. I have a bad mouth and I swear a bit, if you're not comfy with that then definitely unfriend me.

I have the mental stability of a chewed-on shoelace trying to hang onto an old shoe, I am not always up for talking, so if i take some time to answer it's most likely for my own sanity's sake. Not a you problem, I just like time alone.

I don't often get tones in textes/calls but do not require tonetags all of the time. Don't overuse tones with me, it's annoying. 

DNI ;

Basic shit. I don't want any of u pedos, racists, zoo, ableist bs on my profile.

Okegom/ The coffin of Andy and Leyley / Alfred's playhouse / Any of that stuff stay far from me. I literally don't want anything to do with your shit.

If ur not old enough to have discord then please don't interact with me. I'm a grown ass man

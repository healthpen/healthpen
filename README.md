I have no idea how most of you make your Github aesthetic. So deal with . this uhh, decent one.
 
 I go by the name Hazard or Gabriel. If you wish, you can also call me by any skin i sit as! My pronouns are He/It, and I am 20. (01/08!)

 I have very low social energy and often fall quiet or go afk, keep that in mind. I'm also slow to answer in general ...

 I have little to no respect for the english language assume every typo is on purpose /j (I'm a sloppy typer AND i'm  french.)
 
 C+H is appreciated, thought I might not run to cuddle you if we're not close friends LOL. Also, TFC  AREA, You Y/N people... please don't randomly romantically rp with me it kinda scares me lmao


I'm very into Umamusume Pretty Derby, Transformers, No, I'm not a human  and DVN/Hellmet at the moment, thought I'm a big fan of Pokémon, Okami, Mortal Kombat, Transformers and some Roblox titles that i am too lazy to name. I play Limbus Company, HSR and CRK every 3 years

Special niche interest mentions ; i like Sonic X, Utopia (THE BRITISH SERIE!!) , Sims 2, Papa's pizzeria games, Pet Society... These are all very dear to me

Say hi to my beloved wife [Tarn](https://www.patreon.com/SynthesizedHoryzont) !!

BEFORE YOU INT! -



Keep in mind i have a vile humor ; not sexual, thought just jokes that seems offensive. I do use the slurs that i reclaim -- never ones i cannot reclaim. I have a bad mouth and I swear a bit, if you're not comfy with that then definitely unfriend me.

I have the mental stability of a chewed-on shoelace trying to hang onto an old shoe, I am not always up for talking, so if i take some time to answer it's most likely for my own sanity's sake. Not a you problem, I just like time alone.

I don't often get tones in textes/calls but do not require tonetags all of the time. Don't overuse tones with me, it's annoying. 

IWC :

-14 . Dangles reminder that I am old as shit /lh

Hetalia / Forsaken / Hazbin Hotel / Helluva Boss . I don't necessesarily enjoy the fandom/content, and mostly do not enjoy hearing about it due to my own opinion/experience w/ it.

I have no idea how most of you make your Github aesthetic. So deal with . this uhh, decent one.
 
 I go by the name Crow/Gabriel, or any skin i sit as! My pronouns are she/he/it, and I am 19. 

 I have very low social energy and often fall quiet or go afk, keep that in mind. I'm also slow to answer in general ...
 
 C+H is very appreciated, thought I might not run to cuddle you if we're not close friends LOL.

I'm very into Madness Combat and DVN/Hellmet at the moment, thought I'm a big fan of STH, Pokémon, Okami and other Roblox titles that i am too lazy to name. I play Limbus Company and CRK every 3 years
